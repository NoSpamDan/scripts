ADB LOGCAT commands
 V    Verbose (show all possibly useless logs, default level)
 D    Debug (show all reasonable debug logs)
 I    Info (show expected logs for regular usage)
 W    Warn (show possible issues that are not yet errors)
 E    Error (show issues that have caused errors)
 F    Fatal (show issues that are fatal to runtime and will often result in rebooting)
----------
LINUX:


CTRL-ESC - brings up a proces table where you can kill individual processes

CTRL-ALT-ESC - makes the cursur into a skill and cross bones where you can point at a rogue application and kill it

X can be killed with CTRL-ALT-BackSpace

If you hit Ctrl-Alt-F1 (or F2 through 6), you'll be dropped to a virtual console - to return kde: CTRL+ALT+F7.


opensuse shutdown from terminal: qdbus org.kde.ksmserver /KSMServer logout 0 2 2
0 1 2 for reboot
without su or sudo

kdesu APPNAME
e.g.:    kdesu kwrite
otherwise open Su dolphin and open the file from it, it will be editable as root 


Start kde:
First, try to run simply 'X' . If it doesn't run, it should be debugged separately (for this you'd better create a new thread and leave a link to it here). 
Second, try 'init 5'. If everything was set up correctly, it will give you X login screen.
If it fails, run 'xinit' . You'll have X session with a terminal. Try 'startkde'.
